# âœ¨ About me âœ¨

My name is **Vance**. I'm from Taiwan, which is famous for its boba milk tea and TSMC.

- ðŸ’» I'm an junior **electronic engineer** working in an NB manufacturing company.
- ðŸŽ® I'm trying to discover something interesting on github to participate in.
- ðŸ“– I'm lacking software knowledge, so I'm trying to learn by working on projects here.

ðŸ“Œ My goal is to find something that fascinates me so much that I can spend hours studying it.
